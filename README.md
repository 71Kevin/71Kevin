Here's a sneak peek at some of the project prefixes I use and what they do:

- `start`: Fires up the application.
- `commit`: Leverages commitizen for better commits.
- `format:check`: Ensures JavaScript and TypeScript files are nicely formatted with Prettier.
- `format:write`: Beautifies JavaScript and TypeScript files with Prettier.
- `lint:check`: Scans JavaScript and TypeScript files for linting issues using ESLint.
- `lint:fix`: Squashes linting bugs in JavaScript and TypeScript files with ESLint.
- `test`: Runs Jest to ensure JavaScript and TypeScript files are working as expected.
- `dev`: Fires up Nodemon for smooth development of JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
